Actions for Blue Agents:
- Monitor (Collection of info about malicious activity on the network)
- Analyse (Collection of further info on a specific host)
- DeployDecoy (Setup of a decoy on a specific host)
- Remove (Attempt to remove a red agent from a host)
- Restore (Restore a network to a good known state)
- BlockTraffic (Block traffic to and from a specific zone)
- AllowTraffic (Allow traffic to and from a specific zone)

HMARL design:

Split the action set A into a small list of disjoint "meta-actions" 
    1. Investigate all hosts in a zone (Analyse or DeployDecoy)
    2. Recover a host that shows indicate of compromise (Remove or Restore)

observation  →  master chooses c  →  ψ_c picks primitive action  →  env step

Trainining (H-MARL META):
    Phase 1. Train sub-policies first: fix the master policy with the following rule:
        - if Indication Of Compromise (IOC) in the zone -> Recover else Investigate
        - Train each subpolicy with PPO

    Phase 2. Freeze all subpolicies and train Master policy with PPO

Trainining (H-MARL EXPERT):
    Phase 1. Same as H-MARL META
    Phase 2. Deterministic rule (No training): If there is IOC, then Recover
